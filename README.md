# YOLOv3 Object Detection 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to the **YOLOv3_Object_Detection** repository! This project focuses on implementing and training a YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model for object detection based on a custom dataset. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image with a single forward pass through the neural network.

### YOLOv3 Overview 🕵️‍♂️

**YOLOv3**, introduced by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi, builds upon the success of its predecessors by improving accuracy and speed. The model divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. YOLOv3 uses a series of convolutional layers with skip connections, making it a powerful and efficient object detection algorithm.

#### Original Paper 📑

The YOLOv3 model is described in detail in the paper titled "*YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement*" by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi. The paper was presented at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference in 2018. For a deep understanding of the model architecture and training strategies, it is highly recommended to read the original paper, which can be found [here](link_to_paper).

### Project Goals 🎯

This repository aims to provide a step-by-step guide on training and testing a YOLOv3 model using a custom dataset obtained from the [Open Images Dataset](https://opensource.google/projects/open-images-dataset) provided by Google. The instructions below will walk you through the entire process, from setting up the environment to training the model and evaluating its performance.

Now, let's get our hands dirty and kickstart this project!
